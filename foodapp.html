         <p>Have you ever have to prepare a quick meal at home? When you open your fridge, there are only some random ingredients left and you are wondering if you could still create a great entree out of them. Handpick is trying to help you to find the perfect recipe based on the ingredients you already have at hand.</p>

         <p class="spacerS"></p>
         <p class="grayfont">I was the solo in-house designer to lead the product design at Handpick in Feb 2014. The major goal was to improve user experience related to search, discovery and social share, as well as exploring new features that could enhance personalization and user growth.</p>
          
        <p class="spacerS"></p>

        <h2 class="darkfont">User Study &amp; Data Analysis</h2>
        <p class="spacerS"></p>
        <p class="grayfont leftalign">Collabrated with our content strategist and product manager, we identified pain points through user studies &amp; data analysis. Methods used to identify problems including user research videos, google analyze data, in person user studies, etc. </p>

        <p class="spacerS"></p>

        <h2 class="darkfont">Design Ideation &amp; Execution</h2>
        <p class="spacerS"></p>
        <p class="grayfont leftalign">Brainstorm on the feature concept with product manager and the leader of our developer team, followed by a couple of different initial concepts, wireframes &amp; high-fidelity mocks.</p>
        

        <p class="spacerS"></p>
        <h2 class="darkfont">Delivery &amp; Validation</h2>
        <p class="spacerS"></p>
        <p class="grayfont leftalign">I created all the final high-fidelity mocks together with all the detailed specs, and work with our developer team side by side to ensure the delivery of the final design. After each release, we follow up the data and user study to validate the concept.</p>

         <h1>Enhance Search Experience</h1>
         <p class="spacerS"></p>
         <p>One of our main goals is to help user find the recipe based on ingredients. During the user study session we observed that drop off rate increases at the second and third pages. Often time it is because the recipe number is largely reduced after user has put it more ingredients, or the available ingredient list is largely restricted after 1-2 picks.</p>

         <h1 class="darkfont">Accuracy vs More Choices</h1>
         <p class="spacerS"></p>
         <p class="grayfont">A interesting discovery: our product was originally designed to provide accurate results based on the input ingredients. In order to achieve that, the next available ingredient is limited based on the picked ones, while the final search results normally would not have a large list.</p>
         <p class="grayfont">After we identify user pain points from the research, the new strategy was to actually open up the constraints: 1) Always provide full ingredient list for picking; 2) Provide more related recipes in search results.</p>
         <p class="grayfont">The new design concept was made on the assumption that users might want to see more choices available and make their own decistions on the results. Especially when it comes to recipe and cooking, which is really complex and flexible, involving a lot of replaceable ingredients and process.</p>
